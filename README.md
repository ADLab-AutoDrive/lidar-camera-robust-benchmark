# Code of "Benchmarking the Robustness of LiDAR-Camera Fusion for 3D Object Detection"

Here, we release the toolkit to convert a clean LiDAR-camera dataset into a robustness benchmark. In detail, we release two example files for Waymo and nuScences dataset first. Please check our paper for more details. https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14951.

We also publish the robust fusion dataset, benchmark, data format and instructions at our [website](https://anonymous-benchmark.github.io/robust-benchmark-website/).

## Release note
- [x] Toolkit for Waymo Open dataset
- [x] Toolkit for nuScences dataset
- [ ] Generic toolkit for arbitrary dataset.
