# Code of "Benchmarking the Robustness of LiDAR-Camera Fusion for 3D Object Detection"

Here, we release the toolkit to convert a clean LiDAR-camera dataset into a robustness benchmark. In detail, we release two example files for Waymo and nuScences dataset first. Please check our paper for more details. https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14951.

We will post the general toolkit later. Note that our code base is still under construction and will be fully released by the end of June 2022. Stay tuned!

## Release note
- [x] Toolkit for Waymo Open dataset
- [x] Toolkit for nuScences dataset
- [ ] Generic toolkit for arbitrary dataset. 
- [ ] English localization

For now, the readme for each dataset toolkit are in Chinese.
